Large CNC documentation continued from BrettRD

I'm new to Git but here goes. I'm going to collate information regarding the large CNC macine here.

The machine currently operates from serial-PC to one of each X,Y,Z,Spindle, and is capable of machining soft materials. Attempting to machine harder materials can cause the trapezoidal rails of the X-axis to bind (Jarvis, Harmsworth, 2017)

My objective is to reconfigure machine to operate from FPGA-PC to X,X,Y,Z,Spindle so that both X-axis motors are displacement synchronised in order to drive the screws on each trap-rail in parallel (preventing binding).

Things I'll document here:

## Progress
### Initial commit: 

Regroup and brief on project status: 
OriginalDocs is a collection of Brett's documents regarding the CnC breakout board including designs for the PCB.

This will obviously be removed during this upgrade but if it's lying around and you're wondering what it was for then here you go.

#### X,Y axis breakout
By BrettRD
To be removed in the upgrade

#### Z axis breakout
By BrettRD
To be removed in the upgrade

#### Banner SC26-2D Safety Module
From what I understand this is the safety stop unit for the three-phase

#### High voltage sticker
Not sure what's behind it
But lots of potential
And dangerous
Like me

#### MeanWell SDR-960-24
Not sure what this does but I'm sure it Means Well
