Large CNC documentation continued from BrettRD

I'm new to Git but here goes. I'm going to collate information regarding the large CNC macine here.

The machine currently operates from serial-PC to one of each X,Y,Z,Spindle, and is capable of machining soft materials. Attempting to machine harder materials can cause the trapezoidal rails of the X-axis to bind (Jarvis, Harmsworth, 2017)
Previous configuration used two ACM604 servos running from the same pulse source with no feedback. Errors accumulated and built up a torque on the bridge, resulting in an over-current condition and E-stop.  Work continued with one motor disengaged.
The ACM604 motors were upgraded to the 130ST-M10010LB to allow for harder materials, and to permit operation with only one motor on common materials.
Currently, the bridge experiences a large displacement at the non-driven end with only modest forces; synchronised X drive motors are  important to this design.

My objective is to reconfigure machine to operate from FPGA-PC to X,X,Y,Z,Spindle so that both X-axis motors are displacement synchronised in order to drive the screws on each trap-rail in parallel (preventing binding).

The FPGA allows the PC to be aware of the location of the servos, corrected every rotation with a zero-pulse from the encoders.
The PC will control the relative displacement between X-motors directly to permit fine calibration of bridge alignment.

Things I'll document here:
