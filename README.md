Large CNC documentation continued from BrettRD

I'm new to Git but here goes. I'm going to collate information regarding the large CNC macine here.

The machine currently operates from serial-PC to one of each X,Y,Z,Spindle, and is capable of machining soft materials. Attempting to machine harder materials can cause the trapezoidal rails to bind (Jarvis, Harmsworth, 2017)

My objective is to reconfigure machine to operate from FPGA-PC to X,X,Y,Z,Spindle so that both X-axis motors are displacement synchronised in order to drive the screws on each trap-rail in parallel (preventing binding).

Things I'll document here:
