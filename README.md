Large CNC documentation continued from BrettRD

I'm new to Git but here goes. I'm going to collate information regarding the large CNC macine here.

The machine currently operates from serial-PC to one of each X,Y,Z,Spindle, and is capable of machining soft materials. Attempting to machine harder materials can cause the trapezoidal rails of the X-axis to bind (Jarvis, Harmsworth, 2017)

My objective is to reconfigure machine to operate from FPGA-PC to X,X,Y,Z,Spindle so that both X-axis motors are displacement synchronised in order to drive the screws on each trap-rail in parallel (preventing binding).

Things I'll document here:
